        <h1>Me and Dairy - a short history</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>Growing up, I was the poster child for drinking milk. I'd have a huge cup in the morning and one in the evening. I can't say for certain, but I bet if you asked my younger self, they would say it was one of their favorite parts of the day. 
        Other children's parents, while telling them to finish their cups, would say things like "look at how much milk Charu drinks!"</p>
        <p>I would always say my favorite meal was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paneer">paneer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naan">naan</a>, a classic Indian, dairy loaded delicacy. This relationship with dairy remained untarnished through high school. One could say it grew even stronger, as I adopted other dairy products like yakult, or whey protein. </p>
        <p>As I went to college, a lot of changes occurred all at once - I moved to the midwest, not famous for having strong infrastructure for the vegetarian, dairy heavy diet I was used to. The weather became colder. My stress levels grew. Alcohol became something that I participated in. All things that probably were not good for my gut</p>
        <p>I don't think this realization happened all at once, but slowly over time, I'd experience increasing amounts stomach pain from time to time, particularly when having dairy. At some point I started to question the food that I was eating, and eliminated various things from my diet to test what was causing the issue.</p>
        <p>I had to bring myself to the horrible conclusion that I had become lactose intolerant. Much time was spent being in denial of this - with unsatisfactory results. At some point, I had to cut my losses and stop consuming many of the foods that I used to hold dear.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I've tried various otc treatments - <a href="https://shopmilky.com">Milky</a> has been the one that's worked the best - all still not truly hitting the mark. </p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2025, I took a trip to Japan. I was watching some youtube videos prior to the visit and one vlogger with lactose intolerance mentioned the dairy in japan did not impact them. I was skeptical, but curious. And lo and behold when I got there I could eat most of the dairy! I didn't go as far as trying straight milk, but the milk derivatives: cheese, butter, pastries had no impact on me. It was shocking - I spent the rest of the trip getting my fill of dairy, because I knew that once I got back to the dairy-free purgatory that we call the United States, I would miss it dearly. </p>
        <p>While consuming a bagel with cream cheese one breakfast in Tokyo, I had to ask the question: <i>why?</i> Why does this dairy not impact me? There is something fundamentally different about the way Japan does dairy versuse that makes it consumeable.</p>
        <p>This blog is devoted to this exploration, it seems like an interesting place to apply some of the skills I've gathered in debugging complex systems to identify whether a quality-of-life improvement for me and many other lactose intolerant people is truly possible. Plus, learning about the food supply chain - how dairy gets from cow->table - sounds kinda interesting</p>
